# Recipe Site Project

## Introduction

This project is a simple recipe website where users can explore and share different recipes. Throughout this project, I have learned the basics of **HTML** to create web pages, structure content, and display recipe details, as well as **Git** for version control to track changes, collaborate, and maintain the project efficiently.

- **HTML**: I have built a web page structure using HTML, incorporating different sections such as headers, navigation menus, recipe lists, and footers. I've also included features like links, images, and forms to display recipe details and facilitate navigation.
  
- **Git**: I have learned how to use Git for version control, including committing changes, creating branches for new features, and pushing my updates to GitHub. This has allowed me to manage my projectâ€™s history and collaborate effectively.

## Features

- Displaying a list of recipes with details like ingredients, instructions, and preparation time.
- Organizing recipes into categories (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert).
- Simple navigation allowing users to easily explore different sections of the site.
- Adding and editing recipes with forms (future enhancements).

## Skills Demonstrated

- **HTML**: Proficiency in building structured web pages, organizing content, and embedding multimedia such as images and videos.
- **Git**: Managing project versions, collaborating through GitHub, and maintaining the project's history and integrity through proper commit practices.
- **Responsive Layout**: Implementing basic HTML to ensure the website is accessible and displays well across different devices (future enhancement could include more CSS styling).

## Future Enhancements

- **Styling with CSS**: Enhance the website's appearance by styling it with CSS for a more visually appealing design.
- **Interactivity with JavaScript**: Add interactivity such as search and filter functions for recipes.
- **User Contributions**: Implement a feature for users to add their own recipes or rate existing ones.
  
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated basic web development skills using HTML, and an understanding of version control with Git, laying the foundation for more advanced web development techniques.
